# Hey, I am Guy Delarea!
What started with a simple "sudo rm -rf /*" has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting as time goes by. I'm currently working as a DevOps Engineer.


When not working on exciting projects,
I love experimenting with self-hosted technologies in my Home Lab, exploring new ways to deploy / automate / learn and optimize my workflows.
